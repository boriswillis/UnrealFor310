Game Design Project Repository
This repository contains an Unreal Engine project for my Digital Game Design class, showcasing various interactive elements and mechanics. 
The goal is to build and update a comprehensive demo environment with functionality across landscapes, materials, physics, lighting, audio, and more.

Features
Environment and Visual Elements
Landscape: A simple sculpted environment without a custom material.
Materials: Examples of different materials with varied properties, including reflective, emissive, and various other surfaces.
Lighting: Static and dynamic lighting, with functional light setups for atmosphere and immersion.
Light Function: Dynamic effects to create light flicker.

Interactive Elements and Mechanics
Puzzles: Engaging puzzles that test player interactions within the environment.
Triggering: Elements such as audio, lights, particles, materials, physics, etc.

Gameplay Mechanics
Physics: Interactive physics objects that respond to player and environmental influences.
Teleporting: Player teleportation mechanics for seamless movement across the environment.
Fade to Black (Sequencer): Transition effects using Sequencer to manage in-game scenes and cutaways.
Destroy a Mesh: Functionality to destroy objects on specific triggers or conditions.
Launch Character and Ragdoll: Character launching and ragdoll mechanics for dynamic player interactions.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

Open in Unreal Engine: Open the project in Unreal Engine (Version 5.3 or above).

Explore the Level: Test out each feature in the designated zones of the map.

Planned Updates
Future updates will incorporate:

Additional interactivity
Three puzzle examples: lock and key, ordered, and a two-item puzzle.

New environments and themes
Further integrations with player feedback and input mechanisms are possible in future updates.
