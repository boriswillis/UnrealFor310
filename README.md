Game Design Project Repository
This repository contains an Unreal Engine project for my Digital Game Design class, showcasing various interactive elements and mechanics. 
The goal is to build and update a comprehensive demo environment that includes functionality across landscapes, materials, physics, lighting, audio, and more.

Features
Environment and Visual Elements
Landscape: A simple scuplted environment without custom a material.
Materials: Examples of different materials with varied properties, including reflective, emissive, and various other surfaces.
Lighting: Static and dynamic lighting, with functional light setups for atmosphere and immersion.
Light Function: Dynamic effects to create light flicker.

Interactive Elements and Mechanics
Puzzles: Engaging puzzles that test player interactions within the environment.
Triggering Lights: Light-based feedback triggered by player actions, contributing to a dynamic environment.
Audio: Integrated soundscapes, music, and effects that react to in-game events.
Animation and Video: Character animations and video sequences integrated for enhanced storytelling.

Gameplay Mechanics
Physics: Interactive physics objects that respond to player and environmental influences.
Teleporting: Player teleportation mechanics for seamless movement across the environment.
Fade to Black (Sequencer): Transition effects using Sequencer to manage in-game scenes and cutaways.
Destroy a Mesh: Functionality to destroy objects on specific triggers or conditions.
Launch Character and Ragdoll: Character launching and ragdoll mechanics for dynamic player interactions.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

Open in Unreal Engine: Open the project in Unreal Engine (Version 5.3 or above).

Explore the Level: Test out each feature in the designated zones of the map.

Planned Updates
Future updates will incorporate:

Additional interactivity
3 puzzle examples, lock and key, ordered and two item.

New environments and themes
Further integrations with player feedback and input mechanisms.
